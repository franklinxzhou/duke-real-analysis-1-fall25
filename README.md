# MATH 531@Duke
My personal exam review note for Duke University's MATH 531 (Fall 2025), taught by Dr. Jayce Getz. 

The notes are largely based on Rudin, W. (1976) Principles of Mathematical Analysis. 3rd Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 145. However, I also put in some synthesis, personal ideas, ideas from related courses/resources.

I created the markdown files through [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases). It is readable in Github but the LaTeX expressions may not appear as supposed.

Common Abbr:
BWOC = By way of contradiction
WLOG = Without loss of generality
